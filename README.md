### Working Solution

The above solution was only temporary and it didn't work as well as i wanted it to so i went on to learn more so i can find a fix for it.

## Additional Challenges

"Jobs.json" folder to fetch dynamic id, and filtering by onTime Jobs and Remote jobs.

## Final thoughts

This project was not easy at all and the longer i worked on it, the more it took out of me. I started strong and i burnt out 80% through. With that being said, it has also been my favorite project so far because i did not rely fully on tutorials to complete it. I only used tutorials to understand smaller concepts and not full sections.
